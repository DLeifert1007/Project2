## Notebooks

- **Preprocessing.ipynb**: Data preprocessing steps including encoding and scaling.
- **sports_sustainability.ipynb**: Analysis and evaluation of sports sustainability metrics.

## Data

- **sports_management_dataset.csv**: The original dataset containing various features related to sports management.
- **sports_management_encoded.csv**: Fully encoded dataset used for model training and evaluation.

## Usage

1. **Preprocessing**: Use `Preprocessing.ipynb` to understand the dataset and preprocess the data.
2. **Modeling**: Use 'pipeine.py' and `sports_sustainability.ipynb` to run the Gradient Boosting Model
